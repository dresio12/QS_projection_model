Quality Start Projection Model (Work in Progress)

Currently scraping and organizaing the data needed to generate a model to predict the probability of a quality start.

Model variables planned to include: season-long and recent (~6 starts) performance, opposing team season long and recent (~10 games) performance/record, weather, park factor, pitcher handedness

The end goal is to have a self-updating model available to view on a Shiny application
